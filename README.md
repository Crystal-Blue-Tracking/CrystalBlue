# CrystalBlue
This will be a tracking application based upon the one used in Breaking Bad via Hank and the DEA

CREATOR: Julian Morrisette

This application will draw a path designated via the user. It will allow the user to either track from their current location, or from a location of their choosing, and have a path be drawn on a map. They will also be able to add special locations on the map, with an annotation and string to go with it. 

The map being implemented will be MapKit. Location services dealing with coordinates will be CoreLocation. 

If possible, a different color marking the path of the user will be drawn as well. 

Currently, the user is allowed to see paths that are for: driving, walking or biking.
