This will be a tracking application based upon the one used in Breaking Bad via Hank and the DEA

CREATOR: Julian Morrisette

This application finds the users current location. When the user moves, the application follows them, and ought to draw a green path behind them. 

MapKit and CoreLocation are used for the map and location services. 

There may be an error concerning "...corner 4" that may cause the tracking to malfunction. In this case, use the simulator and it will track that moving "user".
