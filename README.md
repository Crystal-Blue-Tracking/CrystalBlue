This will be a tracking application based upon the one used in Breaking Bad via Hank and the DEA

CREATOR: Julian Morrisette

The application will track the location, as well as the movements of the device. Using GoogleMaps or the Swift Maps internal API as the map, and the device's location will be drawn on the map with a colored line. As the device moves, the line will continue to be drawn so long as the device in running (even in the background). 

The application will have a Start and Stop functionality.
The application will continue to draw the line until the Stop button has been pressed. At which point, one can start a new session, or simply stop the application from running. 

Extra features would include: 
Drawing the line in 3D space
Should the device be stationary at any location for longer than 1 minute, the location will be tagged (flag, red dot, ect.)
The accuracy of the movement of the device will be high. (i.e Should the device be in a building, movenents within floors ought to be mapped)
